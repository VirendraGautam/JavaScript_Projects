This project is a Myntra Clone project build using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

Here, I have prepared a Myntra Clone which dynamically add items in the Homepage, adds item to cart, remove items from card when a item is removed, also it dynamically calculates the 
Total Amount that has to be paid by a customer for the item purchase.
